fiber-bed-zarr
==============

This is a [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) image pyramid of a
synchrotron x-ray computed tomography volume of a fiber bed material as its
embedding matrix undergoes an impregnation and curing process.

The original data is from:

  Larson, Natalie M.; Zok, Frank W., "Ex-situ XCT dataset for "X-ray computed
  tomography of microstructure evolution during matrix impregnation and curing
  in unidirectional fiber beds"," 2019, http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.18126/M2QM0Z
